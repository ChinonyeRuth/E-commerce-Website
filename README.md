# E-commerce-Website
E-commerce website created by Chinonye Ibeakanma
I'm excited to announce that I have recently created an ecommerce website that allows businesses to sell their products online using only HTML and CSS.

Creating this website has been a great learning experience for me, as I have gained valuable skills in web design and development. I have enjoyed working with HTML and CSS to create the layout, styling, and functionality of the website.

In the future, I hope to further enhance the website by implementing JavaScript. This will allow me to add even more interactive and dynamic features to the site, making it even more user-friendly and engaging for customers.

I'm thrilled to see what the future holds for this project, and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a web developer. If you are interested in using the website to sell your products, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always happy to help businesses succeed online.
